<h1>Scamazon Delivery Driver Instruction Manual</h1>
<img src="images/van.png" id="van">
Welcome to the most "exciting" job you never wanted! As a delivery driver for Scamazon, you’re not just delivering packages; you’re delivering <span>disappointment!</span> Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure you maximize the hilarity (and mild confusion) of your job. 
<ol>
    <li class="delivery">Gear Up </li>
Slip into your Scamazon-branded vest. Bonus points if it’s two sizes too small—nothing says “professional” like a wedgie!
Take your personal car, preferably one with a few dents and questionable brakes. Remember: the more sketchy, the better! 

    <li class="delivery">Loading the Van</li>
Gather your packages. Ensure they’re all the wrong size, weigh at least 50% more than expected, and are filled with items that make absolutely no sense (think a karaoke machine and a gallon of mayonnaise).
While loading, practice your best “I’m so sorry” face for when customers open their packages to find a rubber chicken instead of a laptop.

    <li class="delivery">The Route</li>
Trust your GPS, but also consider taking a few “shortcuts.” Nothing builds character like getting stuck in a dead-end alley!
Aim to arrive at least 2 hours late. Nothing screams “Scamazon” like a surprise delivery at 11 PM!

    <li class="delivery">Interactions with Customers</li>
Deliver packages by throwing them at the front door from a safe distance. Bonus points if you hit the mailbox!
If a customer asks about their order, respond with an enthusiastic, “It’s on its way!” even if it’s not. Remember: lying is our second language!

    <li class="delivery">Handling Complaints</li>
Customers may express their dissatisfaction. Simply smile and offer them a “Scamazon Credit” (which is just a scribbled note promising nothing).
If they ask about returns, tell them “returns are for quitters” and sprint to your vehicle.

    <li class="delivery">End of the Day</li>
Gather with your fellow Scamazon drivers to share your most outrageous delivery stories. Did you accidentally leave a package at the wrong house? Did someone mistake your van for an ice cream truck? The more absurd, the better!
Get ready for payday! Just remember, your paycheck will always be “in the mail.” 

    <li class="delivery">Celebrate Your Victory</li>
At the end of each day, treat yourself to a nice meal (which you’ll pay for out of your own pocket, of course). Congratulations, you’ve successfully contributed to the confusion of countless customers!

    <li class="delivery">Final Note</li>
Remember, in the world of Scamazon, the only thing you can count on is that nothing will go as planned. Embrace the chaos, and have a laugh while you’re at it! After all, who else can say they’ve delivered a blender to a llama farm? 
</ol>
Good luck, and may your deliveries be ever ridiculous!
